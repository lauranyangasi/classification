# CLASSIFICATION PROJECT				 

## CHURN ANALYSIS 

Profit increase or revenue margin is what every company envisions, and customer retention is critical to the success of every organization which industry players focus their resources on. This project is meant to help organizations perform a churn analysis on their customers.  

In this project, we have also used an interactive Power BI platform to help you get a feel of the data, draw meaningful insights visually and make concise decisions.  

### Why Churn Analysis? 

Churn analysis, also known as customer attrition rate, is the process of evaluating a companyâ€™s customer loss rate to reduce it. 

 

### Churn Analysis involves the following the steps: 

## Data collection and preparation 

   	Collect relevant data about customers, how they interact with the product or service and reasons as to why they churn. 

## Define churn 

	Figure out what involves churn in your business, this could include but not limited to the following; customers failing to buy a product or service for a specific period, customers not renewing a particular service or product, etc. 

## Feature engineering 

	Create meaningful features from the collected dataset that can help explain the churn. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

Carry out analysis on the dataset to identify trends, correlations and patterns related to customer churn.	 

## Model Building 

	Build predictive models that can help forecast the likelihood of customer churn. 

## Model Evaluation 

	Assess the performance of your prediction's models using various models, that is F1 score, recall, accuracy, etc. Select metrics that are appropriate for your business context. 

## Feature importance analysis 

	Determine which features have a great significance and on churn prediction, to get a clear understanding of why the churn and address them accordingly. 

## Actionable insights 

	Identify strategies to reduce the churn based on your findings. This can include offering discounts, targeting campaigns, etc. 

## Implementation and testing 

	Put the strategies into action and monitor their impact on churn rates 

## Reporting and communication. 

     	 Present the outcomes and recommendations to the company stakeholders to be put into action. 

 

### Machine learning in Churn Analysis 

Machine learning provides advanced techniques to carry out predictions, Analys and understand customer churn patterns making it possible for companies to respond appropriately to retain customers. 

It is however important to note that for effective churn analysis, one requires domain knowledge, data quality and a good strategy to act on the insights provided by the machine learning models.
